## Realtime Correlation

- First token latency: 5000 ms
- Inter-token jitter P95: 920 ms
- Visible lag risk: high
- Terminal pressure: not-directly-measured
- Next action: Add runtime trace that correlates ingress cadence, batch flush, render-visible cadence, and terminal settlement.

## Cold Start

- First paint evidence: unsupported
- First interactive evidence: unsupported
- Reason: Tauri webview headless cold-start timing is not available in this script; bundle baseline is recorded.
- Next action: Collect Tauri webview timing on supported macOS/Windows/Linux runners.
