# git-panel-diff-view Specification

## Purpose

Defines the git-panel-diff-view behavior contract, covering Dual List View Modes.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Dual List View Modes

The Git panel SHALL keep Diff-specific view actions discoverable from the `Diff`
mode menu without requiring a separate always-visible toolbar row, and SHALL NOT
expose repository switching from that menu.

#### Scenario: repository switcher is hidden from the Diff menu

- **WHEN** the active Git panel mode is `diff`
- **AND** repository scanning is available for the workspace
- **WHEN** the user opens the `Diff` mode menu
- **THEN** the menu SHALL NOT include an action to switch the Git repository used by the Diff panel
- **AND** the existing repository scan, clear, select, and selector-panel contracts SHALL remain available to non-menu callers.

#### Scenario: Git changes section header uses compact neutral controls

- **WHEN** the Git Diff panel renders staged or unstaged changes in flat or tree list mode
- **THEN** the section title SHALL keep staged and unstaged labels in the normal section text color instead of using success/green status color
- **AND** the section count SHALL render with the project shadcn Badge compact secondary treatment
- **AND** the manual refresh action SHALL stay hidden until the section header is hovered or keyboard-focused, matching the section Stage/Unstage action reveal behavior
- **AND** modified file status markers shown as `M` SHALL use the warning/yellow status color rather than the info/blue accent.

### Requirement: Multi-Repository Change Section Collapse

The multi-repository Diff surface SHALL provide functional staged and unstaged
section collapse controls scoped by workspace identity, repository identity, and section type.
Collapsing a section MUST remain a presentation-only operation.

#### Scenario: collapse one repository section

- **WHEN** the user activates a staged or unstaged section header in a repository group
- **THEN** that section SHALL update its expanded state and hide its file rows
- **AND** the header SHALL expose the current state through `aria-expanded`.

#### Scenario: collapse state is independently scoped

- **WHEN** the user collapses one staged or unstaged section
- **THEN** sections with another type, repository identity, or workspace identity SHALL retain their existing expanded state.

#### Scenario: collapse preserves Git and commit state

- **WHEN** the user collapses or expands a multi-repository section
- **THEN** the operation SHALL NOT change commit selection
- **AND** it SHALL NOT invoke stage, unstage, discard, refresh, or file-open behavior.

### Requirement: Tree Hierarchy Interaction

Tree mode SHALL support folder expand/collapse, file selection, and section-scoped commit inclusion toggles.

#### Scenario: Expand folder

- **WHEN** user expands a folder node
- **THEN** its child folders/files SHALL be visible

#### Scenario: Collapse folder

- **WHEN** user collapses a folder node
- **THEN** its descendants SHALL be hidden

#### Scenario: File metadata visibility

- **WHEN** tree mode renders file nodes
- **THEN** each node SHALL show file status and additions/deletions summary

---

#### Scenario: Folder checkbox reflects descendant commit inclusion state

- **WHEN** tree mode renders a folder inside one section
- **THEN** its checkbox SHALL reflect descendant file inclusion as `none`, `partial`, or `all`
- **AND** toggling that checkbox SHALL apply only to descendant files inside the same section

### Requirement: Single File Diff Focus in Tree Mode

Selecting a file in tree mode SHALL focus diff viewer on that file.

#### Scenario: Select file in tree

- **WHEN** user clicks a file node in tree mode
- **THEN** diff viewer SHALL show that file as focused diff content

#### Scenario: Clear focus

- **WHEN** user triggers “back to all” or clears selection
- **THEN** diff viewer SHALL return to non-focused aggregate state

---

### Requirement: File-Header Controls in Tree Focus Mode

In tree single-file focus mode, diff controls SHALL be attached to the current file header.

#### Scenario: Diff layout switch on file header

- **WHEN** user toggles split/unified controls in file header
- **THEN** current file diff SHALL switch between split and unified layout

#### Scenario: Diff content mode switch on file header

- **WHEN** user toggles `全文查看/区域查看` in file header
- **THEN** content mode SHALL apply to current focused file only

#### Scenario: No duplicated top toolbar

- **WHEN** file-header controls are available
- **THEN** top-level duplicated diff toolbar SHALL NOT be rendered

---

### Requirement: Full View Uses Full-Context Diff

`全文查看` SHALL render full-context diff (including unchanged lines), not only patch-near context.

#### Scenario: Full view data source

- **WHEN** user switches current file to `全文查看`
- **THEN** frontend SHALL request full-context diff for that file
- **AND** full view SHALL include unchanged lines in diff rendering

#### Scenario: Full view status feedback

- **WHEN** full-context diff request resolves
- **THEN** UI SHALL expose request state via button label/status (`FULL/EMPTY/ERR/...`)

---

### Requirement: Floating Change Anchors in Full View

Tree full-view mode SHALL provide floating anchor navigation between change groups.

#### Scenario: Anchor visibility

- **WHEN** current file is in tree mode and `全文查看`
- **THEN** floating anchor control SHALL be visible near diff viewport bottom-right

#### Scenario: Anchor grouping rule

- **WHEN** computing anchors for a file
- **THEN** contiguous changed lines SHALL be grouped as one anchor
- **AND** only line-number jumps create a new anchor

#### Scenario: Anchor navigation

- **WHEN** user clicks prev/next anchor button
- **THEN** viewport SHALL scroll to corresponding change anchor
- **AND** anchor counter SHALL update as `current/total`

---

### Requirement: Backward Compatibility for Git Actions

Existing Git actions and commit inclusion controls SHALL remain available in both view modes without breaking current diff workflows.

#### Scenario: Flat mode regression gate

- **WHEN** changes for tree keyboard/a11y/shortcut behavior are merged
- **THEN** automated regression checks SHALL cover flat mode Stage/Unstage/Revert and commit basics

#### Scenario: Tree interaction test coverage

- **WHEN** feature is implemented
- **THEN** automated tests SHALL cover tree build logic and focus-switch behavior

#### Scenario: Stage/Unstage/Revert in tree mode

- **WHEN** user performs stage/unstage/revert from tree mode
- **THEN** operation behavior SHALL match flat mode semantics

#### Scenario: Commit inclusion controls remain available in both modes

- **WHEN** user switches between `flat` and `tree`
- **THEN** both modes SHALL expose explicit controls to include or exclude files from the next commit

#### Scenario: View switch preserves section-scoped inclusion truth

- **WHEN** user stages / unstages files or changes commit inclusion in one mode and then switches view mode
- **THEN** the other mode SHALL reflect the same section-scoped inclusion state
- **AND** staged / unstaged file counts SHALL remain consistent after the switch

### Requirement: Tree Hierarchy Interaction Accessibility

Tree mode SHALL expose baseline accessibility semantics for assistive technology.

#### Scenario: Tree semantics for folders

- **WHEN** tree renders folder nodes
- **THEN** folder controls SHALL expose `aria-expanded`

#### Scenario: List semantics for actionable nodes

- **WHEN** tree renders selectable nodes
- **THEN** nodes SHALL expose descriptive labels and selected state metadata

---

### Requirement: Git Diff Panel MUST Expose Stable File Preview Affordances

The Git diff panel MUST expose explicit file-scoped preview affordances, and live workspace file review flows opened from those affordances MUST be able to escalate into editable review without breaking existing Git actions or selection semantics.

#### Scenario: file preview action is explicit from changed file rows

- **WHEN** a changed file row is visible in the Git diff panel
- **THEN** the row SHALL expose an explicit preview/open action
- **AND** the action SHALL be distinguishable from include/exclude, stage, unstage, discard, and selection controls

#### Scenario: commit scope outline stays visible in dense panels

- **WHEN** the user is selecting files for commit scope in a dense or high-contrast layout
- **THEN** selected commit-scope controls SHALL have a visible outline or equivalent state boundary
- **AND** the state SHALL remain distinguishable from hover-only styling

#### Scenario: file-scoped review entry can open editable review for live workspace diff

- **WHEN** the user opens a file-scoped live workspace diff review entry from the Git panel
- **THEN** the system MUST allow that review flow to enter editable review mode for the same file
- **AND** saving from that review flow MUST refresh the Git panel's live diff state

### Requirement: Git Diff Panel File Opens MUST Resolve Repository Paths To Workspace Paths

Git status and diff entries are repository-relative, while the file editor read pipeline consumes workspace-relative paths. The Git Diff panel MUST explicitly route changed-file open requests through a Git-path domain before invoking the shared editor open flow.

#### Scenario: Nested git root file open adds workspace prefix

- **GIVEN** the active workspace path is a parent directory of the configured Git root
- **AND** a changed file row path is relative to that Git root
- **WHEN** the user opens that changed file from the Git Diff panel
- **THEN** the editor open request MUST resolve the path to a workspace-relative path by prefixing the Git root's workspace-relative segment
- **AND** the shared file read pipeline MUST receive the resolved workspace-relative path

#### Scenario: Workspace root git file open does not add visual root label

- **GIVEN** the active workspace path is the configured Git root
- **WHEN** the user opens a changed file from the Git Diff panel
- **THEN** the editor open request MUST preserve the repository-relative file path
- **AND** it MUST NOT prefix the visible repository root name used by tree rendering

#### Scenario: Non-Git file open entrypoints remain workspace-relative

- **WHEN** a file is opened from the workspace file tree, search results, activity surface, Project Map evidence, or any other non-Git changed-file row entrypoint
- **THEN** the shared editor open flow MUST treat the input as workspace-relative or absolute workspace path according to the existing workspace file contract
- **AND** it MUST NOT apply the Git root prefix mapping unless the caller explicitly declares the path as Git-domain input

### Requirement: Remote Backend Git Diff Panel Reads

The Git Diff panel SHALL treat non-Git workspace diff reads as an empty,
non-error state across local Tauri and remote daemon backends.

#### Scenario: non-Git workspace does not emit diff command failures

- **WHEN** the active workspace root has no `.git` marker
- **THEN** Git status SHALL report `isGitRepository: false`
- **AND** automatic Git Diff preload SHALL NOT call `get_git_diffs`
- **AND** local Tauri and remote daemon `get_git_diffs` SHALL return an empty diff list if called
- **AND** the client SHALL NOT write a runtime/internal command failure notice for the non-Git diff path.

### Requirement: Git Diff Panel SHALL Use Canonical Change Projection

The Git Diff panel SHALL derive visible changed-file rows from a canonical projection that reconciles status entries and diff entries before rendering file lists or diff viewer inputs.

#### Scenario: Status entries remain authoritative
- **WHEN** a path exists in staged or unstaged status entries and matching diff evidence is available
- **THEN** the Git Diff panel MUST preserve the status-derived path, status, section, additions, deletions, and existing action semantics
- **AND** diff evidence MUST only enrich preview content or media metadata

#### Scenario: Diff-only added file remains visible
- **WHEN** diff evidence contains a file that is not present in the status-derived file list
- **AND** the diff evidence indicates a new file through optional status, `new file mode`, or `--- /dev/null`
- **THEN** the Git Diff panel MUST render that path as an added file instead of silently dropping it

#### Scenario: Diff-only deleted file remains visible
- **WHEN** diff evidence contains a file that is not present in the status-derived file list
- **AND** the diff evidence indicates deletion through optional status, `deleted file mode`, or `+++ /dev/null`
- **THEN** the Git Diff panel MUST render that path as a deleted file instead of silently dropping it

#### Scenario: Diff-only fallback entry is preview-only
- **WHEN** canonical projection creates a visible row from diff evidence without matching staged or unstaged status evidence
- **THEN** that row MUST allow non-mutating preview and focus behavior
- **AND** it MUST NOT expose stage, unstage, discard, or commit inclusion mutation controls until section state is confirmed by status evidence

#### Scenario: Staged and unstaged same-path state is preserved
- **WHEN** the same path has both staged and unstaged status entries
- **THEN** canonical projection MUST preserve both section-scoped entries
- **AND** stage, unstage, discard, preview, and commit inclusion controls MUST continue to target the same section semantics as before

#### Scenario: Canonical identities remain role-specific
- **WHEN** the same path appears in multiple Git panel responsibilities
- **THEN** file-list row identity MUST be section-scoped
- **AND** diff viewer identity MUST remain path-scoped
- **AND** mutation action identity MUST include section and operation semantics

### Requirement: Canonical Git Change Projection SHALL Be Cross-Platform

Canonical Git change projection SHALL behave consistently on Windows, macOS, Linux, and browser/Web Service surfaces.

#### Scenario: Path separators do not change file identity
- **WHEN** status or diff inputs refer to the same repository-relative file using `src/foo.ts` and `src\foo.ts`
- **THEN** canonical projection MUST treat them as the same logical Git path for merge purposes
- **AND** it MUST NOT rely on OS-specific path APIs to determine identity

#### Scenario: Line endings do not change status inference
- **WHEN** diff text uses LF or CRLF line endings
- **THEN** canonical projection MUST infer added, deleted, and modified fallback status consistently
- **AND** additions/deletions best-effort counting MUST classify `+` and `-` diff lines consistently across both line-ending styles

#### Scenario: Web Service and desktop use the same projection rules
- **WHEN** Git Diff panel data arrives from local desktop commands, remote daemon forwarding, or a Web Service-facing interface
- **THEN** the UI MUST apply the same canonical projection rules after data receipt
- **AND** Web-facing behavior MUST NOT diverge through a parallel status/diff merge implementation

#### Scenario: Incomplete Web-facing payloads are handled safely
- **WHEN** a Web-facing Git payload entry lacks `path`
- **THEN** canonical projection MUST discard that entry from visible changed-file rows
- **AND** it MUST use existing diagnostic/error reporting paths where available

#### Scenario: Missing diff does not create fallback entries
- **WHEN** a Web-facing or daemon diff payload omits `diff`
- **AND** no status-derived entry exists for that path
- **THEN** canonical projection MUST NOT synthesize a diff-only fallback row for that entry

### Requirement: Deleted File Rows SHALL Expose Explicit Deleted-State Visual Semantics

Deleted file rows in the Git Diff panel SHALL be visually distinguishable from modified and added files without changing existing actions or accessibility semantics.

#### Scenario: Deleted row uses explicit deleted styling
- **WHEN** a changed file row has status `D`
- **THEN** the row MUST expose a deleted-state visual treatment such as line-through, subdued text, or equivalent deleted affordance
- **AND** the status marker MUST remain distinguishable from added, modified, renamed, and typechange statuses

#### Scenario: Deleted styling preserves interaction affordances
- **WHEN** a deleted file row is selected, focused, hovered, or opened through keyboard interaction
- **THEN** the row MUST preserve existing focus, active, selected, preview, context menu, and commit inclusion affordances
- **AND** the deleted styling MUST NOT hide stage, unstage, discard, or preview controls that were available before

### Requirement: Git Diff Canonical Model SHALL Preserve Payload Compatibility

Git Diff panel canonical projection SHALL be compatible with existing local, remote daemon, and Web Service payloads that omit optional diff status.

#### Scenario: Optional diff status enriches projection
- **WHEN** a diff entry includes an optional status field
- **THEN** canonical projection MAY use that status for fallback entries
- **AND** status-derived staged or unstaged entries MUST still take precedence for existing paths

#### Scenario: Missing optional diff status remains supported
- **WHEN** a local, remote daemon, or Web-facing diff entry omits optional status
- **THEN** canonical projection MUST fall back to diff-header inference
- **AND** existing error handling, loading states, and return-shape compatibility MUST remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Rename headers infer rename display status
- **WHEN** a diff-only entry includes `rename from` and `rename to` headers
- **THEN** canonical projection MUST infer rename display status `R`
- **AND** it MUST NOT require deep rename pairing to preserve existing compatibility

### Requirement: Git Diff Canonical Model SHALL Respect Large-File Governance

Implementation of canonical Git change projection SHALL avoid increasing large-file debt and SHALL remain compatible with the large-file governance workflow.

#### Scenario: Implementation avoids mega-component growth
- **WHEN** canonical projection logic is implemented
- **THEN** merge, inference, path normalization, and stat counting logic MUST live in focused utility code rather than being embedded deeply in large React components
- **AND** component changes MUST remain thin wiring and presentation updates unless the design document records an explicit exception

#### Scenario: Large-file governance remains passable across OS matrix
- **WHEN** the change is ready for review
- **THEN** the implementation MUST be compatible with the workflow steps in `.github/workflows/large-file-governance.yml`
- **AND** it MUST remain suitable for `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, and `windows-latest` runners

### Requirement: Turn Semantic Diff Provides Evidence-Backed Review Facts

The session activity semantic diff SHALL provide evidence-backed review facts for a conversation turn, including deterministic diff-derived facts, validation command evidence, risk hints, and future AI review hints that reference evidence.

#### Scenario: Semantic facts carry structured evidence refs

- **WHEN** a semantic diff fact is rendered
- **THEN** the fact SHALL carry one or more structured evidence refs when concrete evidence exists
- **AND** the UI SHALL expose one compact evidence line without duplicating the same path in a second ref row
- **AND** file-backed evidence SHALL be actionable and open the referenced file line when line data exists
- **AND** long evidence labels and refs such as file paths SHALL wrap within the available surface instead of overflowing or being replaced by an ellipsis.

#### Scenario: Validation command evidence is connected

- **WHEN** a turn contains command events that run validation commands such as tests, lint, typecheck, or OpenSpec validation
- **THEN** the semantic diff SHALL render those commands as validation evidence
- **AND** completed commands SHALL be distinguished from failed commands.

#### Scenario: Test files are not treated as executed tests

- **WHEN** a turn changes test files but has no validation command evidence
- **THEN** the semantic diff MAY show a test-file coverage hint
- **AND** it SHALL NOT claim that tests were run successfully.

#### Scenario: TypeScript and React facts are extracted from hunks

- **WHEN** a turn's diff hunk adds TypeScript exports, React components, hooks, state hooks, or event handlers
- **THEN** the semantic diff SHALL describe those concrete facts when extractable
- **AND** it SHALL cite the file or hunk evidence.

#### Scenario: Test assertion facts are extracted from hunks

- **WHEN** a turn's diff hunk adds test cases or assertions
- **THEN** the semantic diff SHALL describe the added test coverage or assertion surface when extractable
- **AND** it SHALL keep confidence bounded to the diff evidence.

#### Scenario: AI review facts require evidence

- **WHEN** future AI review facts are supplied to the semantic diff model
- **THEN** facts without evidence refs SHALL be ignored
- **AND** AI-sourced facts SHALL render as review hints rather than verified deterministic facts.

#### Scenario: Deterministic facts remain visible with AI review

- **WHEN** AI review facts and deterministic rule facts are both available
- **THEN** the semantic diff SHALL preserve deterministic facts
- **AND** AI review SHALL augment rather than replace them.

### Requirement: Session Activity Shows Turn Artifacts And Semantic Diff

The session activity surface SHALL show which conversation turn produced which changed files and SHALL provide a turn-scoped semantic diff explaining likely change intent, behavior impact, risk, and validation evidence.

#### Scenario: User reviews AI-produced files by conversation turn

- **WHEN** a session activity turn contains one or more file-change events
- **THEN** the turn SHALL render a single artifact module for those changes
- **AND** the artifact module SHALL show a deduped file list rather than a separate `File change` timeline card per event.

#### Scenario: Activity category labels changed files as artifacts

- **WHEN** the session activity category tabs include file-change events
- **THEN** the user-facing tab label SHALL be "Artifacts" / "产物"
- **AND** it SHALL NOT be labeled "File" / "文件".

#### Scenario: Turn artifact module has file and semantic tabs

- **WHEN** the artifact module is visible in an expanded turn
- **THEN** it SHALL provide tabs for the artifact file list and semantic diff
- **AND** the semantic diff tab SHALL remain scoped to that same conversation turn.

#### Scenario: Semantic diff includes turn meaning

- **WHEN** the semantic diff tab is visible and the turn has a user message
- **THEN** the tab SHALL show a compact "Turn meaning" / "本轮语义" section before diff-derived facts
- **AND** the turn meaning SHALL render as escaped text rather than trusted HTML.

#### Scenario: Semantic diff uses compact layout

- **WHEN** semantic diff sections are visible in the session activity panel
- **THEN** the sections SHALL use a single-column layout
- **AND** the artifact header SHALL avoid stacking kicker, title, stats, and tabs across multiple rows when horizontal space allows.

#### Scenario: Turn artifact module uses flat visual treatment

- **WHEN** the artifact module is visible in an expanded turn
- **THEN** the module SHALL avoid outer card borders, inset shadows, raised shadows, and framed tab rails
- **AND** the artifact and semantic content SHALL read as a flat continuation of the turn rather than a nested card.

#### Scenario: Turn artifact content is left-compact

- **WHEN** the artifact file list is visible in an expanded turn
- **THEN** the module SHALL keep left indentation compact relative to nested cards
- **AND** file rows SHALL avoid excessive inner left padding that visually detaches file names from the turn content.

#### Scenario: Turn artifact tabs remain scannable without chrome

- **WHEN** the artifact module tab controls are visible
- **THEN** each tab SHALL include a leading icon plus label
- **AND** the icons SHALL NOT require bordered or raised button chrome to communicate the two modes.

#### Scenario: Concrete code facts are available

- **WHEN** a turn's diff hunk includes concrete code tokens such as exception handlers, endpoint mappings, HTTP status mapping, response envelope calls, exports, or public declarations
- **THEN** the semantic summary SHALL describe those concrete facts
- **AND** it SHALL NOT replace them with generic file-count or file-type statements.

#### Scenario: Evidence boundary is explicit

- **WHEN** the summary is derived only from diff evidence
- **THEN** the UI SHALL avoid presenting inferred statements as verified business facts
- **AND** validation status SHALL state when external validation evidence is not connected.

#### Scenario: Traditional diff remains available

- **WHEN** the user needs line-level evidence for a turn artifact file
- **THEN** the file row SHALL still allow opening the traditional diff preview or file location
- **AND** the standalone Git diff viewer SHALL remain focused on line-level diff review instead of adding a separate global semantic panel.

#### Scenario: Risk hints remain review aids

- **WHEN** the diff touches configuration, tests/specs, deleted files, large file sets, or behavior-facing source files
- **THEN** the semantic summary MAY surface risk hints
- **AND** those hints SHALL NOT block Git actions or mutate commit selection.

### Requirement: Manual Git Status Refresh Affordance

The Git Diff panel SHALL expose a manual refresh affordance for the active workspace Git status without changing the existing automatic polling cadence. In multi-repository mode, each rendered repository change group SHALL expose the same aggregate status refresh affordance in its header.

#### Scenario: User manually refreshes Git status

- **WHEN** the Git Diff panel is visible for an active workspace
- **THEN** the panel SHALL render an icon button with an accessible refresh status label
- **AND** clicking the button SHALL invoke the existing Git status refresh callback.

#### Scenario: Multi-repository headers retain refresh parity

- **WHEN** the Git Diff panel renders repository change groups in multi-repository mode
- **THEN** each repository group header SHALL expose a keyboard-accessible refresh icon button
- **AND** activating any repository header refresh button SHALL invoke the existing aggregate repository status refresh callback
- **AND** an aggregate refresh already in flight SHALL disable the repository header refresh buttons until it settles.

#### Scenario: Manual refresh reuses existing status path

- **WHEN** the refresh affordance is activated
- **THEN** the frontend SHALL reuse the existing `refreshGitStatus` / queued refresh path
- **AND** it SHALL NOT introduce a new backend command or duplicate Git status bridge logic.

#### Scenario: Automatic polling remains unchanged

- **WHEN** the manual refresh affordance is added
- **THEN** the existing active/background Git status polling cadence SHALL remain unchanged
- **AND** existing Git diff, root scan, commit, stage, unstage, discard, and preview actions SHALL remain available.

### Requirement: Git Diff Status Polling Cadence

The Git Diff panel SHALL use a 15s Git status polling cadence for both active
and background modes.

#### Scenario: active and background polling use the same cadence

- **WHEN** a Git workspace remains open in active or background polling mode
- **THEN** the next Git status refresh SHALL be scheduled after 15s
- **AND** heavy changesets SHALL NOT extend the cadence beyond 15s.

### Requirement: Hub file selection uses one visual contract

Git Hub file sections MUST 让 row selection、checkbox state 与 section-level actions 表达同一 selected path set，且 selection styling MUST 不依赖另一个 panel 的 lazy CSS。

#### Scenario: Select files from a Hub section

- **WHEN** 用户在 changed、staged 或 untracked section 选择文件
- **THEN** row、checkbox 与 section action MUST 反映相同 selection，且切换 section 不得产生 phantom selection

### Requirement: Diff file opening preserves repository-relative identity

Git diff file opening MUST 结合 workspace root 与 repository-relative path 解析目标文件，sub-repository entry MUST NOT 被错误拼接到 parent repository root。

#### Scenario: Open a file changed in a sub-repository

- **WHEN** diff entry 属于 workspace 内的 nested Git repository
- **THEN** file open action MUST 定位到 nested repository 中的真实文件，而不得打开 parent root 下的同名或不存在路径

### Requirement: Git Diff Changed-File Context Menus SHALL Be Unified

The Git Diff panel SHALL expose the same `Git` context submenu for mutation-enabled changed-file rows in single-repository and multi-repository modes. The menu SHALL reuse the shared renderer context-menu surface and SHALL NOT fall back to the WebView native context menu.

#### Scenario: single and multi repository rows use the same Git submenu

- **WHEN** the user opens the context menu for a status-backed single-repository flat/tree row or multi-repository grouped row
- **THEN** the system SHALL prevent the WebView native context menu
- **AND** it SHALL render a root `Git` submenu using the shared `RendererContextMenu`
- **AND** repository topology SHALL NOT change the submenu presentation or action ordering.

#### Scenario: staged row exposes only unstage

- **WHEN** the user opens the Git submenu for a staged changed-file row
- **THEN** the submenu SHALL expose `Unstage file`
- **AND** it SHALL NOT expose Stage or Discard actions for that staged row.

#### Scenario: unstaged row exposes stage and discard

- **WHEN** the user opens the Git submenu for an unstaged changed-file row
- **THEN** the submenu SHALL expose `Stage file`
- **AND** it SHALL expose `Discard change` with destructive visual semantics
- **AND** it SHALL NOT expose Unstage for that unstaged row.

#### Scenario: disabled mutation row does not expose Git mutations

- **WHEN** a changed-file row is diff-only, `mutationDisabled`, stale, or has no available mutation callback
- **THEN** the system SHALL prevent the WebView native context menu
- **AND** it SHALL NOT expose Stage, Unstage, or Discard actions.

#### Scenario: opening a menu is presentation-only

- **WHEN** the user opens, navigates, dismisses, or cancels a changed-file context menu
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT open the file, change commit inclusion, collapse a section, or refresh Git status
- **AND** it SHALL NOT execute a mutation until the user activates a concrete menu item.

#### Scenario: topology changes invalidate an open file menu

- **WHEN** the workspace, repository status topology, file section, mutation availability, or scoped callback changes while a changed-file context menu is open
- **THEN** the system SHALL close that file context menu
- **AND** the stale menu action SHALL NOT remain activatable against its previous target.

### Requirement: Git Diff File Context Actions MUST Preserve Repository And Section Scope

Every Git Diff file context action MUST target the clicked row's workspace, explicit repository identity, section, normalized repository-relative path, and operation. Context-menu actions SHALL reuse existing mutation, confirmation, and refresh paths instead of invoking a parallel Git service flow.

#### Scenario: same relative path in two repositories stays isolated

- **WHEN** two repository groups contain the same repository-relative path
- **AND** the user activates a context action on the second repository's row
- **THEN** the mutation callback MUST receive the second row's `repositoryRoot + path`
- **AND** it MUST NOT mutate the first repository.

#### Scenario: workspace-root repository identity remains explicit

- **WHEN** a multi-repository row belongs to `repositoryRoot === ""`
- **THEN** its context action MUST preserve the empty string as explicit workspace-root identity
- **AND** it MUST NOT fall back to a configured nested repository.

#### Scenario: same path in staged and unstaged sections follows clicked section

- **WHEN** the same path has staged and unstaged evidence
- **AND** the user opens the context menu on one section's row
- **THEN** the action matrix MUST be derived from the clicked section
- **AND** path-only matching MUST NOT expose operations from the sibling section.

#### Scenario: single repository bulk target remains section-local

- **WHEN** multiple selected rows include the context-menu target
- **THEN** a bulk context action MUST include only mutation-enabled selected paths from the clicked section
- **AND** it MUST NOT mutate selected paths from another section or repository.

#### Scenario: discard reuses confirmation and refresh

- **WHEN** the user activates Discard from an unstaged file context menu
- **THEN** the existing destructive confirmation dialog SHALL open before mutation
- **AND** cancel SHALL perform zero mutations
- **AND** confirm SHALL execute the existing current-repository or explicit-repository revert path
- **AND** a successful multi-repository revert SHALL refresh aggregate repository status exactly once.

#### Scenario: multi repository stage and unstage refresh once

- **WHEN** a multi-repository Stage or Unstage context action succeeds
- **THEN** the existing scoped mutation callback SHALL receive `repositoryRoot + path`
- **AND** the aggregate repository status refresh callback SHALL run exactly once.

### Requirement: Git Diff File Context Menu SHALL Expose Clicked-File History

The Git Diff panel SHALL expose `Git -> 显示文件历史` for a changed-file row when the host provides File History navigation and the row can be mapped to a valid workspace/repository/file identity. The History action MUST remain read-only and MUST target the clicked row rather than the current bulk mutation selection.

#### Scenario: Single root repository row opens file history

- **WHEN** the user activates `显示文件历史` for a single-repository changed-file row whose Git root is the workspace root
- **THEN** the system SHALL open File History with the active `workspaceId/workspacePath`
- **AND** it SHALL use `repositoryRoot=""` and the normalized repository-relative clicked path.

#### Scenario: Single nested repository row opens file history

- **WHEN** the active single repository is nested below the workspace root
- **AND** the user activates `显示文件历史` for one of its changed-file rows
- **THEN** the target SHALL use the normalized workspace-relative repository root
- **AND** `path` SHALL remain repository-relative while `displayPath` SHALL be workspace-relative.

#### Scenario: Multi repository row preserves explicit identity

- **WHEN** two repository groups contain the same relative path
- **AND** the user activates History on one group
- **THEN** the target MUST preserve that row's exact `repositoryRoot + path`
- **AND** `repositoryRoot=""` MUST remain an explicit workspace-root identity.

#### Scenario: History ignores bulk mutation selection

- **WHEN** multiple single-repository changed files are selected
- **AND** the user activates History from one clicked row
- **THEN** the system SHALL open exactly the clicked file's history
- **AND** it SHALL NOT derive the History target from the selected path collection.

#### Scenario: Read-only history remains available without mutations

- **WHEN** a valid status-backed row is diff-only or `mutationDisabled`
- **AND** the host provides File History navigation
- **THEN** the Git submenu SHALL expose `显示文件历史`
- **AND** it SHALL NOT expose Stage, Unstage, or Discard.

#### Scenario: Invalid history capability does not create a dead entry

- **WHEN** the host callback, workspace identity, repository scope, or valid relative path is unavailable
- **THEN** the system SHALL omit `显示文件历史`
- **AND** it SHALL preserve any independently available mutation actions.

#### Scenario: History menu target becomes stale

- **WHEN** workspace path, repository topology, or File History callback identity changes while a Git Diff file menu is open
- **THEN** the system SHALL close that file menu
- **AND** the previous History target SHALL NOT remain activatable.
