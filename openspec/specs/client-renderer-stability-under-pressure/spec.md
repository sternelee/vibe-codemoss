# client-renderer-stability-under-pressure Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change harden-client-renderer-stability-under-pressure. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Renderer heartbeat MUST provide a backend-observable liveness signal
The system SHALL emit a privacy-safe renderer heartbeat that lets the backend distinguish normal renderer activity from missed heartbeat windows.

#### Scenario: heartbeat is recorded without content
- **WHEN** the renderer heartbeat is sent
- **THEN** the backend MUST record timestamp, platform, app version, active workspace/thread identifiers when available, and diagnostic support flags
- **AND** the heartbeat payload MUST NOT include prompt text, assistant text, tool output, file content, environment values or screenshots

#### Scenario: heartbeat misses are classified
- **WHEN** the backend does not receive the renderer heartbeat within the configured threshold
- **THEN** the system MUST record a bounded `renderer.heartbeat_missed` or equivalent diagnostic
- **AND** the diagnostic MUST distinguish heartbeat evidence from confirmed native process crash evidence

### Requirement: Renderer process failure evidence MUST be feature-detected by platform
The system SHALL capture native renderer process failure or unresponsive evidence when the current platform and WebView stack expose a supported hook.

#### Scenario: native hook is supported
- **WHEN** the platform reports renderer process failure, browser/web process exit, or equivalent unresponsive event
- **THEN** the system MUST record event kind, platform, timestamp, recovery eligibility, and any safe exit reason/code exposed by the platform
- **AND** the system MUST NOT require prompt/body content to diagnose the event

#### Scenario: native hook is unsupported
- **WHEN** a platform does not expose a safe renderer process failure hook
- **THEN** the system MUST record the hook support state as `unsupported` or `not-implemented`
- **AND** heartbeat/watchdog evidence MUST remain available as the portable fallback

### Requirement: Renderer pressure snapshots MUST be bounded and redacted
The system SHALL attach bounded renderer pressure snapshots to stability diagnostics so long-run white-screen cases can be investigated without leaking user content.

#### Scenario: pressure snapshot is emitted
- **WHEN** renderer heartbeat misses, process failure, unresponsive state, or recovery is recorded
- **THEN** the system MUST include bounded metadata for active engine count, active streaming turn count, background helper process count when supported, memory/long-task support status, and current recovery attempt count
- **AND** the diagnostic store MUST cap repeated snapshots by label and time window

### Requirement: Renderer recovery MUST use backoff and preserve user context
The system SHALL only attempt renderer reload or rebuild recovery through a bounded policy that records evidence before recovery.

#### Scenario: recovery is attempted
- **WHEN** a renderer failure is classified as recoverable
- **THEN** the system MUST record the failure evidence before attempting reload or rebuild
- **AND** repeated recovery attempts MUST use a bounded backoff
- **AND** unsent Composer draft state MUST be preserved or the user MUST see a clear diagnostic recovery state

#### Scenario: recovery is blocked
- **WHEN** recovery attempts exceed the configured limit or required state cannot be preserved
- **THEN** the system MUST stop automatic recovery
- **AND** the user MUST be shown a diagnostic state instead of entering an infinite reload loop

### Requirement: Renderer Pressure Diagnostics MUST Include Resource Retention Evidence

Renderer stability diagnostics SHALL include bounded, privacy-safe evidence for long-running resource retention that can degrade interaction smoothness.

#### Scenario: long-running client reports resource-owner counts

- **WHEN** the renderer records a pressure snapshot during or after repeated realtime turns
- **THEN** the snapshot MUST include bounded support/count fields for active listeners, timers, RAF or idle callbacks, canvas render caches, and diagnostics buffer pressure when available
- **AND** the snapshot MUST NOT include prompt text, assistant text, tool output, file content, environment values, or screenshots

#### Scenario: stale resource cleanup is observable

- **WHEN** a workspace/thread/canvas scope is torn down
- **THEN** diagnostics or tests MUST be able to prove owned listeners/timers/caches are released, cancelled, or bounded
- **AND** late callbacks MUST be guarded against post-teardown state writes

### Requirement: Conversation Render Failures MUST Be Classified And Contained Locally

Renderer stability under pressure MUST classify conversation-local render failures, including React #185 / update-loop-style failures, without leaking conversation content and without unnecessary full-app failure escalation.

#### Scenario: React update-loop style failure is diagnosed content-safely
- **WHEN** a conversation row, heavy Markdown island, tool-card detail, diff detail, anchor rail, or popover triggers a React #185 / maximum update depth style failure
- **THEN** diagnostics MUST record a content-safe failure entry with component surface, workspace id, thread id, row kind, engine when known, render weight, and bounded stack/classification data
- **AND** diagnostics MUST NOT include prompt text, assistant body text, tool output body, diff body, file content, screenshots, or environment values

#### Scenario: local fallback prevents global crash when possible
- **WHEN** the failure is contained by a conversation-local boundary
- **THEN** the app shell, Composer, navigation, and other conversation rows MUST remain usable
- **AND** the local fallback MUST expose a recoverable retry or rehydrate path where safe

#### Scenario: repeated local failures are backoff-limited
- **WHEN** the same row or heavy island repeatedly fails after retry or rehydrate attempts
- **THEN** automatic retries MUST stop after a documented limit
- **AND** diagnostics MUST record the blocked recovery state instead of entering an infinite render/reload loop

### Requirement: Conversation Measurement And Overlay Updates MUST Be Loop-Guarded

Conversation renderer measurement, anchor, tooltip, and popover logic MUST avoid unbounded state-update loops under heavy histories and MUST release long-lived resources when the conversation changes.

#### Scenario: repeated measurement updates are bounded
- **WHEN** virtualization measurement, row resize observation, anchor readiness, tooltip placement, or popover placement receives repeated equivalent values
- **THEN** the renderer MUST avoid redundant state writes for unchanged effective state
- **AND** any forced remeasure path MUST have a documented per-row or per-frame bound

#### Scenario: overlay and measurement diagnostics are content-safe
- **WHEN** a repeated measurement, anchor, tooltip, or popover update-loop guard is triggered
- **THEN** diagnostics MUST record surface, row kind, counter, threshold, and component classification data
- **AND** diagnostics MUST NOT include prompt text, assistant body text, tool output body, diff body, file content, screenshots, or environment values

#### Scenario: long-running conversation resources are released
- **WHEN** the selected thread changes, a heavy row unmounts, lightweight mode changes, or an async hydration/precompute request becomes stale
- **THEN** observers, timers, pending callbacks, hydration queue entries, and measurement cache entries associated with the stale surface MUST be released or ignored
- **AND** diagnostics SHOULD expose bounded live resource counts without conversation content

### Requirement: Optional Render Diagnostics MUST Fail Safe

Production render diagnostics MUST NOT trap the client in a persistent startup or reload loop when their instrumentation amplifies a React maximum-update-depth failure.

#### Scenario: persisted react-scan overlay encounters React #185

- **WHEN** the persisted react-scan overlay is enabled
- **AND** the global renderer boundary catches `Maximum update depth exceeded` or minified React error `#185`
- **THEN** the client MUST clear the optional react-scan startup state
- **AND** it MUST retry once without react-scan instrumentation
- **AND** repeated recovery MUST be bounded to prevent an automatic reload loop

#### Scenario: unrelated renderer error keeps normal recovery

- **WHEN** the global renderer boundary catches an error outside the maximum-update-depth class
- **THEN** the client MUST retain the normal ErrorBoundary details and manual reload path
- **AND** it MUST NOT disable react-scan solely because an unrelated component failed

#### Scenario: persisted overlay cleanup fails

- **WHEN** the client cannot clear the persisted react-scan startup state
- **THEN** it MUST roll back the one-shot recovery guard so a later attempt remains possible
- **AND** it MUST retain the normal ErrorBoundary path and record a content-safe recovery-failure diagnostic

### Requirement: Cold-start sibling projections MUST NOT publish workspace-derived equivalent state

AppShell cold-start hooks MUST keep persisted/event-owned source snapshots separate from workspace-derived projections. An equivalent `workspaces` collection reference change MUST NOT schedule a React state update, and a real storage or workspace catalog change MUST still update the visible projection.

#### Scenario: Equivalent workspace catalog is recreated during hydration

- **WHEN** cold-start hydration recreates a `workspaces` array with the same ordered `id/name` values
- **THEN** Quick Switcher recent-file source state MUST retain its previous reference
- **AND** AppShell MUST NOT reach React `Maximum update depth exceeded` or minified error `#185`

#### Scenario: Storage changes before the listener is attached

- **WHEN** a sibling cold-start effect updates recent-file storage before the Quick Switcher listener effect attaches
- **THEN** the post-subscription refresh MUST observe the latest normalized snapshot exactly once
- **AND** the visible recent-file groups MUST include the real change

#### Scenario: Workspace name changes

- **WHEN** a workspace keeps its identity but its observable name changes
- **THEN** the projected recent-file group MUST publish the new workspace name
- **AND** no client-store schema migration MUST be required
