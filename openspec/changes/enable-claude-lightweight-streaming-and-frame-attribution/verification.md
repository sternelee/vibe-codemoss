# Verification: enable-claude-lightweight-streaming-and-frame-attribution

## Status

**NOT READY FOR ARCHIVE** — 15/18 tasks complete.

## Confirmed Evidence

- Code-level and automated tasks are marked complete in the task record.
- Proposal/design/specs preserve lossless finalization and frame attribution as required behavior.
- 2026-07-18 code calibration confirmed staged Claude streaming, runtime diagnostics, frame-drop attribution, `topRenders`, and export surfaces remain present.

## Outstanding Gates

- Run one rebuilt-app trace using the heavy-history scenario retained by the archived `harden-conversation-rendering-for-large-history` change.
- Measure current FPS/frame gaps/long tasks; the historical “6 → 30–50+” target is not accepted as current evidence.
- In the same run, visually confirm lightweight streaming fidelity and lossless transition to the full finalized message.
- After human acceptance, run strict validation, sync main specs, and archive.

## Archive Decision

The intended performance outcome is empirical. Archive remains blocked on one shared trace, not on additional implementation.
