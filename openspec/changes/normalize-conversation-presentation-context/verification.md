# Verification

## Status

Implementation and automated verification completed on 2026-07-21. Pending implementation commit、Trellis session record and OpenSpec archive.

## Baseline

- Roadmap baseline used the seven existing requested files that are present in the repository: 124 tests passed. `src/features/threads/loaders/codexHistoryLoader.test.ts` does not exist, so its loader behavior is covered by `historyLoaders.test.ts` and realtime/history parity contracts.
- Final focused parity set: 8 files passed, 130 tests passed, covering conversation normalization、realtime/history parity、Claude history、messages conversation state、note-card、rich content、user presentation and the new neutral normalizer.

## Implementation Evidence

- Added shared discriminated presentation types to `src/types/conversation.ts` while retaining raw browser、intent-canvas、memory and note-card transport fields.
- Added the top-level integration boundary `src/conversation-presentation/normalizeConversationPresentation.ts` (372 lines) and browser context adapter (14 lines).
- `normalizeItem` now attaches metadata for realtime and history assembly; assistant metadata is recomputed as streaming text grows, while immutable user metadata is reused.
- `messagesUserPresentation`、`messageRowPresentation` and memory/note suppression consume metadata first. Legacy parsing is confined to the normalization compatibility boundary and existing utility exports.
- Messages row/presentation modules have zero direct import from browser-agent、intent-canvas、project-memory or note-cards.
- `check:messages-boundaries` reports inbound 3/3, outbound 54/61, removed 7, new 0.

## Verification Evidence

- Messages + threads + conversation-presentation regression: 421 test files passed; 2067 tests passed, 7 skipped.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed with only existing CSS property、mixed import and chunk-size warnings.
- `npm run check:runtime-contracts`: passed.
- `npm run check:messages-boundaries`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `check:large-files:gate` reproduced the repository-wide 51-file strict baseline. This phase introduces no new large-file finding; the new normalization and adapter files remain below their applicable thresholds.

## Review

- Independent `codex review --uncommitted` found no actionable correctness issue.
- The review independently reran typecheck、lint、messages boundary and focused normalization/history regression tests successfully.

## Baseline Qualifiers

- The roadmap file remains local and untracked.
- Repository-wide `openspec validate --all --strict` has unrelated existing failures; this change validates strictly in isolation.
- No manual desktop interaction session was run; automated rendering、history、realtime and suppression tests cover the changed behavior.
